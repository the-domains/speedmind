description: "On a road trip across Germany earlier this year, my wife and I made a four-hour detour to visit Miniatur Wunderland. It's Hamburg's most popular tourist attraction and it was, without question, worth the trip. Miniatur Wunderland is the Guinness Book of World Records-certified largest model railroad in the world, with more than 150 staff."
