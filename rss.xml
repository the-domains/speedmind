            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Tesla's newest Easter egg hides a rainbow inside the charging port</h1><p>It may be an upstart in the automotive world, but Tesla already has a healthy tradition of including Easter eggs in its software updates. The most recent to be spotted treats Tesla owners to a miniature light show - Model S and Model X owners who press the button on their car's charging handle ten times in quick succession will see their charging port light up in the colors of the rainbow.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/043f909b568c7dfba6296ce73e5c619e0a729e76.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Nvidia's new graphics cards are a big deal</h1><p>The hotly anticipated Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 is now official, marking a major leap in performance and efficiency with the introduction of the new Pascal architecture. How major? Take the ultra beefy and expensive Titan X graphics card from last year, slice its power demands from 250W to 180W, cut its price from $999 to $599, and then throw in a bit more performance on top.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/aeeb83eb2d7c1b8e24dc081cfc6fdaf9f32981e5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Miniatur Wunderland is a jaw-dropping sight for kids young and old</h1><p>On a road trip across Germany earlier this year, my wife and I made a four-hour detour to visit Miniatur Wunderland. It's Hamburg's most popular tourist attraction and it was, without question, worth the trip. Miniatur Wunderland is the Guinness Book of World Records-certified largest model railroad in the world, with more than 150 staff.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fafd5a84cc5d58234fdc5a028bd79a77e040a47f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
